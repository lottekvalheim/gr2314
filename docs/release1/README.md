# CoutureRental release 1  
In release 1 we used most of the time building the groundwork of the project and working on getting a good Git workflow. 

When you open the application, you will arrive at the ProductOverview page, made with JavaFX in SceneBuilder, where you find pictures of the products and a button that you can click to change the status of the product from avaliable to unavaliable. This information is saved in a txt file. 

## Requirements
### Maven
Maven is used to build, test and run the application. 
### Git
All task connected to this release is stored in GitLab under milestone 1. All the issues is connected to their own branch. Each member of the group have been assigned to different issues, but most of the issues have been solved with pair coding. 
### Documentation
All the documentation is provided in README.md files in root and codebase directories that describe the application. 

## Reflection 
### Setting up the project
We did have some issues with the initial setup, because we did not use the template right away, however, after we cloned with the right template, we managed to set up the project with the right file structure. 

A lot of our time in this sprint went to trying to solve different Maven related issues, but with good teamwork, we managed to sovle them. 

### Git 
None of us had a lot of experience working with git before, and it was a big adjustment. So a lot of the time went to learning about git rules and practise. For instance, we had to change the layout of our commit and issue messages from longer format in norwegian to shorter and more precise messages, in english. 

## Summary
We have learned a lot about Git workflow and we have done a lot of trial and error working with different issues and branches. After release 1, we are now ready for the next sprint, with a lot of new ideas and knowledge.
