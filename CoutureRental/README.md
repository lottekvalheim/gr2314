# Couture Rental

### Description

Couture Rental is an application where employees can manage and keep track of which of the products is avaliable for rental, and what products are already rented out.

We have three scenes, one that creates an user, one scene for log in, and one that gives the employee an overview over the current product and its avalibility status.


### Release 1 and 2

### Release 3
We decided to change the size of the scenes in release 3, as we thought it would fit better the applications purpose. We added two more scenes to the application for more functionality. We have changed the productOverview scene, in which we added a scrollpane.
